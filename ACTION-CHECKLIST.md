# ✅ ACTION CHECKLIST - Start Here

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found & Fixed

1. ❌ **Activities API returns 500** → ✅ **FIXED** (collation issue)
2. ❌ **Tasks page redirects to login** → ✅ **FIXED** (token persistence)

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE STEPS (Do This Now)

### Step 1: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
**Wait for server to show**: `ready - started server on ...`

### Step 2: Test Activities Page
```
Open in browser: http://localhost:3000/rabin/dashboard/activities
Expected: Should load successfully, showing activities list
If 500 error: Check server console for remaining errors
```

### Step 3: Test Login Flow
```
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/rabin/login
2. Enter your credentials and click "ورود به سیستم"
3. After login, open browser console (F12)
4. Look for messages starting with "✅"
```

### Step 4: Test Tasks Page
```
1. After login, navigate to: http://localhost:3000/rabin/dashboard/tasks
Expected: Page loads (NOT redirect to login)

2. Press F5 to reload page
Expected: Still on tasks page (NOT redirect to login)
```

## 📋 BROWSER CONSOLE CHECKS (Press F12)

### After Successful Login - You Should See:
```
✅ Auth token found in cookie
✅ Token stored in localStorage
✅ User info stored in localStorage
✅ Login successful, redirecting to dashboard...
```

### On Tasks Page - You Should See:
```
✅ Auth token found in cookie
✅ Auth Response Status: 200
✅ User found in auth/me: [user-id] [email]
```

### If You See Errors - Check:
- ⚠️  No auth token found in cookies or localStorage
  → Token not being stored after login (check login console output)
  
- ❌ Auth response not ok: 401
  → Token invalid or expired (try logging in again)

---

## 🗄️ DATABASE FIX (Optional but Recommended)

### Run Collation Fix Script
```bash
node scripts/fix-collation-issue.cjs
```

**This will:**
- Show current table collations
- Fix all tables to use `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`
- Verify the fix was successful

**Benefits:**
- Prevents future collation errors
- Improves query performance
- Makes database consistent
