# 🔧 Database Connection Leak Fixes - Complete Report

## مسئلهٔ اصلی
**"Too many connections"** error was happening because:
1. Database connections were not being properly released back to the pool
2. Connection pools were being exhausted by leaked connections
3. This caused subsequent requests to fail with 500 errors and redirect to `/tenant-not-found`

## ✅ مشکلات حل شدہ

### 1. **Authentication Permissions API** 
📁 File: `app/api/auth/permissions/route.ts`

**مسئلہ:**
- Line 44: Got a Pool but used it as a Connection
- Called `connection.query()` directly without `pool.getConnection()`
- Never released the connection back to the pool

**حل:**
```typescript
// ❌ Before (Wrong)
const connection = await getTenantConnection(tenantKey);
const [users] = await connection.query(...);  // Connection never released!

// ✅ After (Correct)
const pool = await getTenantConnection(tenantKey);
const connection = await pool.getConnection();
try {
  const [users] = await connection.query(...);
} finally {
  connection.release();  // Always release!
}
```

### 2. **Customers API** 
📁 File: `app/api/tenant/customers/route.ts`

**مسائل:**
- `handleGetCustomers()`: Called `connection.end()` on a pool (destroying the cached pool!)
- `handleCreateCustomer()`: Had unnecessary code calling `connection.end()` on the pool

**حل:**
- Changed to properly use `pool.getConnection()` 
- Release connections with `connection.release()`, NOT `.end()`
- Never close cached pools!

---

### 3. **Dashboard API** 
📁 File: `app/api/tenant/dashboard/route.ts`

**مسئلہ - بہت خطرناک:**
- Lines 32-40: Creating a **NEW** pool for every request! 
- Lines 43-114: Calling `pool.query()` multiple times without releasing connections
- Never closed the pool, creating massive memory leak

**حل:**
```typescript
// Use cached pool from getTenantConnection
const pool = await getTenantConnection(tenantKey);
const connection = await pool.getConnection();

try {
  // All 8 queries now use the same connection
  const [customersCount] = await connection.query(...);
  const [tasksCount] = await connection.query(...);
  // ... etc
} finally {
  connection.release();  // Release ONE connection, not close pool
}
```

## 🚀 بہتریاں

### Pool Size Increases
Increased connection pool sizes to handle more concurrent requests:

**Master Database** (`lib/master-database.ts`):
- ❌ Old: `connectionLimit: 10`
- ✅ New: `connectionLimit: 20`

**Tenant Database** (`lib/tenant-database.ts`):
- ❌ Old: `connectionLimit: 10`
- ✅ New: `connectionLimit: 20`

### Keep-Alive Configuration
Added connection keep-alive settings:
```typescript
enableKeepAlive: true,
keepAliveInitialDelay: 0
```
This prevents connections from timing out during periods of inactivity.

## 📋 تبدیل شدہ فائلیں

1. ✅ `app/api/auth/permissions/route.ts` - Fixed connection management
2. ✅ `app/api/tenant/customers/route.ts` - Fixed connection leaks in GET & POST
3. ✅ `app/api/tenant/dashboard/route.ts` - Eliminated pool creation per request
4. ✅ `lib/master-database.ts` - Increased pool size + keep-alive
5. ✅ `lib/tenant-database.ts` - Increased pool size + keep-alive

## 🔑 اہم اصول

### ✅ Correct Pattern
```typescript
const pool = await getTenantConnection(tenantKey);
const connection = await pool.getConnection();

try {
  // Use connection for queries
  const [rows] = await connection.query(sql, params);
  return NextResponse.json({ data: rows });
} finally {
  connection.release();  // ALWAYS release in finally!
}
```

### ❌ Wrong Patterns to Avoid

1. **Using pool as connection:**
   ```typescript
   const connection = await getTenantConnection(...);
   await connection.query(...);  // ❌ No release!
   ```

2. **Closing the pool (destroys cache):**
   ```typescript
   finally {
     await connection.end();  // ❌ This closes the whole pool!
   }
   ```

3. **Creating new pool each time:**
   ```typescript
   const pool = mysql.createPool({...});  // ❌ Creates leak!
   ```

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

1. **Restart the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify no "Too many connections" errors:**
   - Check browser console
   - Check server logs
   - Try creating customers and other operations

3. **Monitor pool stats** (if needed):
   - The connection pools should stabilize
   - No more 500 errors with "Too many connections"

## 📊 توقع شدہ نتائج

### Before Fix:
- ❌ "Too many connections" error after few requests
- ❌ `/tenant-not-found` redirects
- ❌ 500 errors on API calls
- ❌ Connection pool exhausted

### After Fix:
- ✅ Connections properly released
- ✅ Dashboard loads without errors

## 📝 یادداشتیں

- The fixes ensure connections are always released, even if queries fail
- Connection pools are cached per tenant for efficiency
- Never call `.end()` on a cached pool - only use `.release()` on individual connections
- Always use try/finally to guarantee connection release
